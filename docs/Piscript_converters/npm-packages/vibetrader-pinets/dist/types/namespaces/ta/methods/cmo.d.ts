/**
 * Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO)
 *
 * Calculates the difference between the sum of recent gains and the sum of recent losses
 * and then divides the result by the sum of all price movement over the same period.
 *
 * Pine Script Formula:
 * mom = change(src)
 * sm1 = sum((mom >= 0) ? mom : 0.0, length)
 * sm2 = sum((mom >= 0) ? 0.0 : -mom, length)
 * cmo = 100 * (sm1 - sm2) / (sm1 + sm2)
 *
 * @param source - Source series (typically close)
 * @param length - Number of bars (lookback period)
 * @returns CMO value (-100 to +100)
