# Withdraw

Withdraw assets from your Bybit account. You can make an off-chain transfer if the target wallet address is from Bybit. This means that no blockchain fee will be charged.

Note that, although the API rate limit for this endpoint is 5 req/s, there is also a secondary limit: you can only withdraw once every 10 seconds per chain/coin combination.

tip
- Make sure you have whitelisted your wallet address here
- Request by the master UID's api key only

formulafeeType=0:**

- withdrawPercentageFee != 0: handlingFee = inputAmount / (1 - withdrawPercentageFee) * withdrawPercentageFee + withdrawFee
- withdrawPercentageFee = 0: handlingFee = withdrawFee

**feeType=1:**

- withdrawPercentageFee != 0: handlingFee = withdrawFee + (inputAmount - withdrawFee) * withdrawPercentageFee
- withdrawPercentageFee = 0: handlingFee = withdrawFee
