# Demo Trading Service

## Introduction​

Bybit v5 Open API supports demo trading account, but please note not** every API is available for demo trading account because demo trading service is
mainly for trading experience purpose, so that it does not have a complete function compared with the real trading service.

## Create API Key​

1. You need to log in to your mainnet account;
2. Switch to `Demo Trading`, please note it is an independent account for demo trading only, and it has its own user ID;
3. Hover the mouse on user avatar, then click "API" to generate api key and secret;

## Usage rules​

- Basic trading rules are the same as real trading
- Orders generated in demo trading keep 7 days
- Default rate limit, not upgradable

## Domain​

**Mainnet Demo Trading URL:**

Rest API: `https://api-demo.bybit.com`

Websocket: `wss://stream-demo.bybit.com` (note that this only supports the private streams; public data is identical to that found on mainnet with `wss://stream.bybit.com`; WS Trade is not supported)

## Tips​

- Please note that demo trading is an isolated module. When you create the key from demo trading, please use above domain to connect.
- By the way, it is meaningless to use demo trading service in the testnet website, so do not create a key from Testnet demo trading.
